At the lowest stage, two branches of justice - civil and criminal are bifurcated. The Panchayat courts functioning in civil and criminal areas under various regional names like Nyaya Panchayat, Panchayat Adalat, Gram Kutchery etc.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Munsiff’s courts are next level civil courts, the jurisdictions of which are determined by High Courts. Above Munsiffs are subordinate judges who have unlimited pecuniary jurisdiction and act as first appeals from munsiffs.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">At District level, District Judge is the highest judicial authority in the district having original and appellate jurisdiction in both civil and criminal matters. The District judge hears first appeals from subordinate judges as well as Munsiffs (unless dealt by subordinate judges) and possess unlimited jurisdiction over both civil and criminal suits. He also has supervisory powers over subordinate judges. He’s known as district judge when he deals with civil cases and session’s judge when dealing with criminal cases. Appeals against his order lie with the High Court. The Sessions judge can impose any sentence including life imprisonment and capital punishment. However, the High Court needs to confirm the sentence of capital punishment even if there is no appeal from the convict. Since enactment of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, trial of criminal cases is done by the judicial magistrates only.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Judicial and Metropolitan magistrates discharge judicial functions under administrative control of High Courts in contrast to Executive Magistrates who discharge executive function of maintaining law and order, under control of the state government. The  civil judicial administration in previously presidency towns is currently taken up by metropolitan courts. Original jurisdiction of High Courts tries bigger civil suits arising within the previously presidency areas. Civil suits of lower value are tried by civil courts.</p>  <p  style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2.1. Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008 </p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The act is aimed at providing speedy and inexpensive justice to people in rural areas at their doorsteps by establishing a village court at the grassroot level. This came into force from 2nd October, 2009. This system was also aimed to clear the <b>backlog of more than 2.6 crore cases </b>that are pending before the subordinate courts.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part1476.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1478.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><script src="index.js"></script>
