There are various reasons which demanded a transition to a new institution of NITI Aayog:</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 83pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">Political character of the institution- Far from being the think-tank for providing strategic vision for the country, the Commission was reduced to a political tool of the central government for dictating the policy choices of state governments and micro managing implementation.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 83pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">By the mid-1960s after a series of plan failure the Planning Commission changed from an investment to a spending body. The phenomenal increase in government plans and schemes, dating to the mid-1980s, took place at the Commission’s behest and coincided with India’s looming fiscal crisis.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;"><span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">Huge diversity of the country made centralized planning an incongruity</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">State governments have better information about what is required at the local level</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;"><span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">Plethora of Centrally Sponsored Schemes with one size fits all approach</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 83pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">It also served as a template for other extra-constitutional establishments (for example, the National Advisory Council) that came to lord over elected governments and states.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 83pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">The fall of centrally-planned economies across the world.
