Ayodhya Dispute</h3><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A dispute had been going on for many decades over the mosque known as Babri Masjid at Ayodhya, built by Mir Baqi Tashqandi, Mughal Emperor Babur&#39;s General. Some Hindus believe that it was built after demolishing a temple of Lord Rama which is believed to be his birthplace. The dispute reached to the court and in <b>late 1940&#39;s </b>the mosque was locked up as the matter was with court.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: left;"></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In <b>February 1986, </b>the Faizabad district court ordered that Babri Masjid premises to be unlocked so that Hindus could offer prayers at the statue which they considered as a temple. Soon with the unlocking of doors, mobilisation on communal lines began on both the sides. Gradually the local issue became national issue and increased the communal tensions.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In <b>December 1992 </b>many Karsevaks of Hindu Right Wing faction like VHP, Bajrang Dal etc. arrived at Ayodhya in the name Karseva, voluntary service by devotees to build Ram temple. Meanwhile the Apex Court ordered that State government must ensure that disputed site won&#39;t be endangered. However thousands of peoples arrived there and demolished the Babri Masjid on 6 December 1992 and vitiated the peaceful atmosphere in the country and it was followed by communal riots in the country at large scale, in which lots of people died. Then Union government dismissed state government and appointed <b>Librehan Commission </b>to investigation circumstance leading to demolition of mosque.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part88.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part90.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><script src="index.js"></script>
