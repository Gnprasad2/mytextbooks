Indian National Movement <span class="p">was a part of the worldwide struggle against colonialism and imperialism. India&#39;s struggle influenced the liberation movements of many Asian and African countries.

The </span>Afro Asian Bandung Conference 1955<span class="p">, marked the Zenith of India&#39;s engagement with the newly independent Asian and African Nationals. The </span>Bandung Conference later led to the establishment of the NAM<span class="p">.

By not tying  India  to anyone bloc, non- alignment enabled India to develop economic ties with countries on both sides of the divide. India could thus acquire, as per the need, capital, technology, machines and food from the Western countries. On the other hand it could rely on Soviet Union, after 1954, for building heavy industries in the public sector when The United States was reluctant to do so.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part64.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part66.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><script src="index.js"></script>
